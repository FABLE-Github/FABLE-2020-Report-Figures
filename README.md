Instructions:
(1) These scripts run in R, a general use coding language and environment. If you are unfamiliar with R, start here (https://cran.r-project.org/) and install both R and R-Studio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer. Both are free.

(2) Copy the zipped folder "FABLE 2020 Report Figures.zip" and extract its contents into the directory of your choice, here called "\~/yourpath/" for convenience. (If you are using Windows, this will look like "C://\~/path/"; and if you're using a Mac, "User//\~/path/".)

(3) All the necessary scripts and data are in the folder "FABLE 2020 Report Figures.zip" with the proper directory structure as called in the Master.R script. 

(4) Open the script "//\~/yourpath/Programs/Master.R" in R-Studio and change:
"path" to whatever you use for "~/yourpath/". E.g., 
change the following
path <- "C:/Users/Clara Douzal/OneDrive - SDSN Association Paris/FABLE/FABLE 2020 Report Figures/" #edit this yourself
to
path <- "C:/~/yourpath/" #edit this yourself

(5) Line 13 of Master.R, copy/paste between the quote marks your country name ,from the list line 7 to 11.
 
(6) Press Ctrl + Maj + Entr to run the entire Master.R script.

(7) From lines 151 to 169 you can add "#" before the fct_Function that you do not wish to run

(8) Your figures are stored automatically in individual figures folders in "~/yourpath/Outputs/" and the date automatically added to the file's name.
